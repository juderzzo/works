K15 -- Capture Bubble Toil Trouble
2020-04-01

1
Prediction: Upon clicking on each cell, an alert will pop up with the text in the cell
as the message.
Actual: As predicted.

2
Prediction: Upon clicking on the table but not on a cell (i.e. on the border), only the
table's alert message will be sent. Upon clicking on a cell, as JS events bubble up through
the DOM by default, the cell's alert will occur first, followed by the row's and the table's.
Actual: As predicted.

3
Prediction: Without uncommenting stopPropagation, the table's pop up will occur first, then
the row's, then the table's as the true argument in the table's eventListener sets the
propagation mode to capture. Uncommenting stopPropagation will stop the event's propagation,
so only the table's alert will occur.
Actual: The event was captured at the table's level, but then bubbled up from the cell as the
rows' eventListener was not set to capture. The alerts actually occurred in the following
order: table, cell, row. Uncommenting stopPropagation did stop the propagation early, so
only the table's alert occurred.

4
Prediction: The order the eventListeners are added does not matter. As all the eventListeners
are set to capture, the table's alert will occur first, followed by the row's and the cell's.
Uncommenting stopPropagation will stop the propagation after the table's alert.
Actual: As predicted.
